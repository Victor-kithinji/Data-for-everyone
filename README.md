Imagine you're working with Sprint, one of the biggest telecom companies in the USA. They're really keen on figuring out how many customers might decide to leave them in the coming months. Luckily, they've got a bunch of past data about when customers have left before, as well as info about who these customers are, what they've bought, and other things like that.

So, if you were in charge of predicting customer churn how would you go about using machine learning to make a good guess about which customers might leave? Like, what steps would you take to create a machine learning model that can predict if someone's going to leave or not?

**How to create the customer churn predicting model**

Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries

Import the required Python libraries for data manipulation and machine learning.

Step 2: Load Your Dataset

Load your dataset containing historical customer data.

Step 3: Data Preprocessing

Preprocess the data to make it suitable for modeling.
Handle missing values, if any, by removing or imputing them.
Encode categorical features into a numerical format. In this example, we used one-hot encoding to convert the 'Contract' feature.

Step 4: Split Data into Features and Target Variable

Separate the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (y), where 'Churn' is the variable you want to predict.

Step 5: Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

Split the dataset into two subsets: one for training the model and the other for testing the model's performance.
The test_size parameter determines the proportion of data used for testing.

Step 6: Standardize Numerical Features

Standardize (scale) numerical features to ensure they have similar scales. This is important for many machine learning algorithms.

Step 7: Train a Machine Learning Model

Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm. In this example, we used a Random Forest Classifier, but you can experiment with different algorithms.
Train the model using the training data.

Step 8: Make Predictions

Use the trained model to make predictions on the test set.

Step 9: Evaluate the Model

Assess the model's performance using various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, confusion matrix, and a classification report.
